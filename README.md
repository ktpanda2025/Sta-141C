## question to be asked 

Question to be asked, does an artist have better songs when they collaberate with others?,does the tempo of the song determine the artist succsess, any other of the song attributes??.

Focues on a specific artist looking at if there song made it to the charts and why. Focusing on metadata of the song.


Lets say we choose Drake we get all of  songs then make a new column for songs that made it onto the.
