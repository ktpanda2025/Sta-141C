## week # status update

Week of FEB 5 figured out project idea and data
## question to be asked 


Lets say we choose Drake we get all of his songs then make a new column for songs that made it onto the top 100 or 200 vs those that didnt.\n
We can then use the attributes like loudness,dancibility etc... to see this and then maybe make some predction to see. 


Data would be cut down to only inlclude songs from 2017 forward as that when spotify started collecting info on this.
